# Pyramids

Using the [WIPP Pyramid Building plugin](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-pyramid-plugin), users can generate pyramidal representations of their images and explore them in the Pyramid Deep Zoom view. Click on "Data" on the menu bar, then "Pyramids" to access the list of Pyramids.

This view displays the list of available Pyramids, which can be sorted by name and creation date and size. The sorting is achieved by clicking on the arrows next to the column headings. 
The edit box below the heading "Name"" is designed for entering text to filter the list of items shown below. Click on the name of a pyramid to access the pyramid deep zoom view.
